# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

This repository is a place for various minimalistic tools that are occassionally useful, do not relate to any project, and in many cases are written over and over.

## Directory structure

is very simple - each microtool has its own directory, where the script, all its resources, and a little `README.md` file can be placed.

It's best (though currently not required) if you attach also a test script - please name it like `test.sh`, `test.py` etc. and make it executable.

## Contributions are welcome!

just fork this,make sure you give your tool a good name (=simple, descriptive and unique) and send me a pull-request. Thanks!
